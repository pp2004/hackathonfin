Persona Porfolios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A set of 47 client portfolios has been provided for the Hackathon. These represent two types of investor personas: Reactive and Established.

What You’ll Find in This Tab
For each portfolio, you’ll see key information:
•	Client Persona: The investor type assigned to the client. Use this to tailor your messaging—approaches should differ for “Reactive” vs. “Established” investors.
•	Portfolio Volatility: The current risk level of the client’s portfolio. Higher volatility means higher investment risk.
•	SAA Portfolio Volatility: The risk level if the client followed the CIO’s model portfolio for their risk tolerance. For example, a D (Balanced) risk profile in the CIO model might be 33% bonds, 50% equities, 12% alternatives, and 5% liquidity, with an expected volatility of 9.5%.
•	Number of Positions: The number of different investments in the client’s portfolio as of June 2025.

Persona Descriptions
•	Reactive Investor: Tends to react emotionally or anxiously to market downturns.
•	Established Investor: Follows a disciplined, structured investment strategy.

Risk Tolerance for the Hackathon
For simplicity, only two risk tolerance levels are included:
•	D (Balanced)
•	F (Equities)
